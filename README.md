TODO:
  - The data is hard-coded in the app. A great refactor is to add a service to contain the data.
  - The details page is currently displayed on the same page, but it would be cool to move the details to their own page and take advantage of Angular routing.
  - One other update would be to host the data at a rest endpoint and use the HTTP package in Angular to load the data at runtime.

# Introduction to Angular Codelab

In this codelab, you'll build a housing app with Angular. This is the completed app and features the ability to view home listings based on user search, and view details of a housing location.

You'll build everything with Angular using Angular's powerful tooling and great browser integration.

Here's a preview of the application:
